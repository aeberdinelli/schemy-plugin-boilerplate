# Plugin boilerplate
This is a template for writing [Schemy](https://github.com/aeberdinelli/schemy) plugins. 
To start writing your plugin, you can clone this repository, create a fork or just use it as a reference.
There are examples for all the available plugin hooks within Schemy inside `src/index.js`. 

## Note
No matter what you choose, remember to update this `README.md` file and add an easy to read setup of your plugin!
